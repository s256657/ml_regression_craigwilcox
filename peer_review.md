1. Clarity and Organization
- Great organization and very easy to follow
- Great use of either numbers or bullet points during reflections or explanations to keep things organized and clear
- Maybe some opportunities within coding boxes to comment to let others know what the code is going to do or what the purpose is
- Also after a couple python cells there are alerts that the code could be adjusted for suture use. Did not effect output but did effect what how the workbook looks

2. Feature Selection and Justification
- Excellent choices and justification on this
- Could have used data in previous charts to enhance the reasoning but would not have changed the choices necessarily

3. Model Performance and Comparisons
- Your models performed reasonably well
- I do not have anything to add and learned a lot from observing how your models performed and thinking how I wish I had done a peer review prior to completing my project

4. Reflection Quality
- Really enjoyed your reflections as they brought perspectives together
- Your next steps really had me thinking specifically the "creating interaction flags" and how that would enhance the predictions always something mroe to learn for me

Thank you Eric for your contribution and I will continue to look for your work as I learned a lot by reading what you completed and it will enhance my next project.
